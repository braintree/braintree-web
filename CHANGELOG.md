    `createPaymentRequest`. This method returns a new object and
    does not mutate the argument

  check for specific errors:

      hostedFieldsInstance.tokenize(function (err, payload) {
        if (err && err.code === 'FIELDS_EMPTY') {
          // Handle user input error
        }
      });

- Fix an incorrect `<script>` tag example in API docs

- Fix an error in Require.js API docs

- Hosted Fields

    possible card types

    within the current year were treated as valid
- PayPal
  - Add `useraction` option to `paypal.tokenize`

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- UnionPay improvements.
  - Card capabilities
    - Renamed `isUnionPayEnrollmentRequired` to `isSupported`.
    - When `isSupported` is false, Braintree cannot process
      UnionPay card. Customer would need to use a different card.
  - Enrollment response has `smsCodeRequired` flag.
    - If `true`, customer will receive an SMS code, that is
      required for tokenization.
    - If `false`, SMS code should not be passed during
      tokenization. Tokenization can be done immediately.

## 3.0.0-beta.10

- Return a human readable error message when requests are
  rate-limited.
- Add 3D Secure component.
- Hosted Fields
  - Throw an error when initializing with an invalid field key. See
    **BREAKING CHANGES**.
  - The formatting for expiration dates no longer inserts a leading
    `0` if the date begins with `1`. This prevents the numbers from
    jumping around for dates beginning `01`, `10`, `11`, or `12`.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- An error is now returned when initializing Hosted Fields with an
  invalid field; it is no longer silently ignored.

## 3.0.0-beta.9

- No longer throws exceptions when using `require('braintree-web')`
  during server-side rendering with libraries such as React.js.
- `index.js` and `debug.js` in the npm/bower modules no longer
  reference `package.json`.
- Ajax errors in IE9 now report as general error instead of an empty
  string. It is impossible to get details additional about network
  errors in IE9 XDomainRequests.
- Add 3D Secure component
- UnionPay
  - Expiration date or month/year together are now optional as some
    UnionPay cards do not have expiration dates.
- PayPal
  - All `create` options aside from `client` have now moved to
    `tokenize`. See **BREAKING CHANGES**.
  - For one-time checkout, add `intent` option which can be `sale`
    or `authorize`
  - HTTPS is no longer required
  - Add `offerCredit` as an option to `tokenize` for offering
    customers PayPal Credit as a form of payment

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- PayPal's `create` options have moved to `tokenize`. Deferring these
  options to tokenization time allows greater flexibility in your
  checkout experience.

      braintree.paypal.create({
        client: clientInstance
      }, function (err, paypalInstance) {
        paypalInstance.tokenize({
          flow: 'checkout',
          amount: '10.00',
          currency: 'USD'
        }, function (tokenizeErr, payload) {
          // ...
        });
      });

  - The `create` API has changed. `options.kount` for
    `dataCollector.create` is now a simple boolean:

        dataCollector.create({
          client: clientInstance,
          kount: true,
          paypal: true
        }, function (err, collector) {});

## 3.0.0-beta.7

- Hosted Fields
  - Add `inputSubmitRequest` event which is called when the user
    presses the Enter key (or equivalent) in a Hosted Fields input.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- Hosted Fields
  - The `fieldStateChange` event is now 4 events: `empty`,
    `notEmpty`, `validityChange`, and `cardTypeChange`
  - Change event payloads to always return the full state of the
    form and all possible card types
- Data Collector
  - A `client` option is now required

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- UnionPay
  - `fetchCapabilities` now takes `card: {number: '4111'}` instead
    of `cardNumber: '4111'`
  - `enroll` now takes mobile phone data under the `mobile` property
    instead of the `card` property
  - `enroll` now returns a property called `enrollmentId` instead of
    `unionpayEnrollmentId`
  - Removed the `options.options` property from `tokenize`;
    `smsCode` and `enrollmentId` are now top-level options

## 3.0.0-beta.5

- Improve documentation of callbacks
- Hosted Fields
  - Calling methods (such as `tokenize` or `setPlaceholder`) after
    Hosted Fields has been torn down throws an error
- PayPal
  - Calling methods (such as `tokenize`) after PayPal has been torn
    down throws an error
- DataCollector
  - Throw an error when trying to tear down twice
- American Express
  - `getRewardsBalance` to get the rewards balance of a Braintree
    nonce
  - `getExpressCheckoutProfile` to get the Express Checkout profile
    of an Amex nonce
- UnionPay

    version

    enabled

    `shippingAddressEditable`, which disables user editing of
    shipping address when set to false.
  - Replace `singleUse` boolean property with `flow` string
    property. `singleUse: true` is now `flow: 'checkout'`. `flow` is
    required; use `flow: 'vault'` for Vault flow.

| Old                 | New                |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `singleUse` omitted | `flow: 'vault'`    |
| `singleUse: false`  | `flow: 'vault'`    |
| `singleUse: true`   | `flow: 'checkout'` |

## 3.0.0-beta.1

This release contains a number of new features for developers and their
users, the key benefits are listed below. This is a significant
departure from our earlier versions of the JS SDK. It is a composable
SDK instead of a collection of pre-defined integration patterns (better
for more advanced developers):

- Smaller File Size

  > Results in faster load times and improves performance of their web
  > applications. A merchant has the choice to control the size by
  > controlling the components they use. To illustrate the
  > implications of this: a merchant who is only using PayPal does not
  > need to include (and subsequently force their users to download)
  > the code for Hosted Fields, DataCollector, etc. if they are not
  > leveraging these features.

- Modular Architecture for Advanced Developers

  > Rebuilt with a module-first approach. Developers have the choice
  > and control over the specific JS SDK components they’d like to use
  > instead of using the full SDK. The value of this is that it
  > results in a simpler integration and also has been something many
  > advanced developers have requested.

- Custom PayPal Button

  > Developers have the option to customize the PayPal button that is
  > displayed on their page. We provide only a bindable programmatic
  > handler.

- Hosted Fields Formatting

  > Many developers who use Hosted Fields have asked us for more
  > robust abilities to format input into the Hosted Fields Form
  > Fields for UX reasons. The new SDK allows fields to be formatted.
  > One example of this is clean spacing between card numbers (4111
  > 1111 1111 1111 instead of 4111111111111111).

- No Dependency on Form Submissions

  > Traditionally, our SDK has required developers to submit payment
  > information in the context of a form. We no longer require
  > developers to integrate with this pattern. Modern web applications
  > tend to be built with richer client-side functionality
  > (validation, multiple payment options, AJAX submission, etc.).
  > Deferring the mechanics of tokenization to a simple API call in
  > our SDK allows our libraries to be much less intrusive as far as
  > developer experience goes.

- CORS Support, as opposed to JSONP

  > CORS is a Web Security technology that allows developers tight
  > control over which third party services can be rendered within
  > their web page. This is now the default.

- Improved .NET Experience

  > .NET developers who use the WebForms Technology have run into many
  > issues with previous versions of our SDK related to competing form
  > submission handling. Since we no longer rely on form submissions,
  > native .NET form handling is left untouched.

- Improved Documentation

  > By its very nature, this new release is more low-level and less
  > opinionated about contextual integration. This means we can
  > provide an API reference and simpler getting started guides.

- Modern distribution

  > By focusing on npm and GitHub as release channels the SDK fits
  > better with newer build pipelines and tooling.

- Improved error messaging

  > Better error handling and presentation everywhere, with clearer
  > error messaging.
