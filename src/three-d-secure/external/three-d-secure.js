For example, if you're processing a transaction for 1.234,56 € then `amount` should be `1234.56`.
 * @param {string} [options.accountType] The account type for the card (if known). Accepted values: `credit` or `debit`.
 * @param {boolean} [options.cardAddChallengeRequested] If set to `true`, a card-add challenge will be requested from the issuer. If set to `false`, a card-add challenge will not be requested. If the param is missing, a card-add challenge will only be requested for $0 amount. An authentication created using this flag should only be used for vaulting operations (creation of customers' credit cards or payment methods) and not for creating transactions.

 * @param {boolean} [options.dataOnlyRequested] Indicates whether to use the data only flow. In this flow, frictionless 3DS is ensured for Mastercard cardholders as the card scheme provides a risk score for the issuer to determine whether to approve. If data only is not supported by the processor, a validation error will be raised. Non-Mastercard cardholders will fallback to a normal 3DS flow.

 * @param {boolean} [options.requestVisaDAF] Request to use VISA Digital Authentication Framework. If set to true, a Visa DAF authenticated payment credential will be created and/or used for authentication if the merchant is eligible.
 * @param {string} [options.merchantName] Allows to override the merchant name that is shown in the challenge.
 * @param {string} [options.requestedExemptionType] If an exemption is requested and the exemption's conditions are satisfied, then it will be applied. The following supported exemptions are defined as per PSD2 regulation: `low_value`, `transaction_risk_analysis`
 * @param {object} [options.customFields] Object where each key is the name of a custom field which has been configured in the Control Panel. In the Control Panel you can configure 3D Secure Rules which trigger on certain values.
